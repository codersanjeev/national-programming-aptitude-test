/**
*  QUESTION STATEMENT 
*
*  >------------------------------------Most frequent 3 integers---------------------------------------<
*  
*   Complete the following function that finds the three most frequently occurring integers in positions a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1] of an array. 
*
*	The most frequently occurring integer should be stored in b[0], the next most frequently occurring integer should be stored in b[1], and the next most frequently occurring integers should be stored in b[2]. 
*
*	You can assume that the array contains at least three distinct values, and there are no ties in terms of frequency among the three most frequently occurring elements.
*
*	Note: The rest of the program, which reads the input values, calls your function, and prints the output has already been written for you.
*
*	Hint: Sort the array a[] and find the three biggest blocks.
